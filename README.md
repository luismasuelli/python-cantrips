python-dirty-checks
===================

This could be considered as a partial port of AngularJS regarding $scope service. However, only the digest part is considered, since the services, controllers, modules, ... part is not developed at all, and directives and DOM-related stuff has no sense at all in a python environment (that's why I did not name the repository as "angularpy" or something alike)
